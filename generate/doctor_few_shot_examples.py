The second box details the induction of pulpitis after drilling a hole in the two maxillary first molars and the injection of 5 \u00b5L of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into each tooth. The diagram indicates the division of animals by duration (0, 6 or 24 h) of pulpitis induction. The third box illustrates the pulpotomy procedure and pulp sampling with sterile paper tips for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. Hemostasis (represented with a schematic drawing and a photograph) was achieved by injecting sterile saline and applying slight pressure with a sterile cotton pellet. Then, BiodentineTM cement was used to fill the coronal pulp space. A micro-CT exam confirmed the postoperative result. The final box details the distribution of animals by treatment duration before sacrifice, 4 or 15 days, for histological and immunochemical analysis. A final micro-CT exam before sacrifice allowed verification of the impermeability of the obturation. All 27 animals were included in the analysis; no animals were excluded. The sample size was decided using the resource equation method (PMID 24250214), and an error degree of freedom of 22 was considered as indicating an acceptable sample size. Rats were randomly assigned to one of the groups. A numbering strategy was used to minimize potential confusion of animals, while permitting a level of blinding of operators during the experiment.",
